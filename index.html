						MyMoneyZen helps you organise your everyday money so that you can pay bills easily, fully enjoy spending and achieve your dreams sooner.
					</h4>
					<h3>Proactive</h3>
					<p>We don't get you to track expenses because it's time consuming & just helps you track the mistakes you've already made. What we do, is make it easy for you to find out exactly how much of your pay is needed for your bills & financial commitments ahead of time - for reals (normally a very tricky number), and that’s when the magic happens. You can then harness the remainder by choosing ahead of time what you want to do with it; spend or save, or both.</p>

						<li>Spending money hits your account once a week (see at a glance how much you have to spend, if there's money in your spending account, go nuts!)</li>
						<li>Savings goals are automatically being achieved</li>
					</ul>
					<p>MyMoneyZen also keeps an eye on your bills bank balance for you, just in case, and lets you know if there’s a problem and how to rectify it, before there’s even a problem.</p>

The focus on having everything then automated by setting up scheduled bank transfers felt like magic once it was all setup. Easy and fun, does actually make it easy.”</em></li>
