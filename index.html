					MyMoneyZen has helped us create peace of mind. After the initial set up time we have then been able to get on with our lives and know we are living within our means as well as working towards our goals. What a great philosophy and system it is.

				<blockquote>
					MyMoneyZen was great for getting down to the nitty gritty of what exactly was needed to get on top of my finances. The focus on having everything then automated by setting up scheduled bank transfers felt like magic once it was all setup. Easy and fun, does actually make it easy.
