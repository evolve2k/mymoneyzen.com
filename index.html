					<p>
						MyMoneyZen helps you organise your everyday money so that you can pay bills easily, fully enjoy spending and save more money to achieve your dreams sooner.
					</p>
					<h3>Proactive</h3>
					<p>It's proactive, rather than reactive. We don't get you to track expenses because it's time consuming & just helps you track the mistakes you've already made. What we do, is make it easy for you to find out exactly how much of your pay is needed for your bills & financial commitments ahead of time - for reals (normally a very tricky number), and that’s when the magic happens. You can then harness the remainder by choosing ahead of time what you want to do with it; spend or save, or both.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Set and Forget</h3>
					<p>Follow through with your new budget is automatic, using a series of separate bank accounts & automatic transfers.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bills money is put aside ready to go</li>
						<li>Spending money hits your account once a week (see at a glance how much you have to spend, if there's money in your spending account, go nuts!)</li>
						<li>Savings goals are automatically being achieved</li>
					</ul>
					<p>MyMoneyZen also keeps an eye on your bills bank balance for you, just in case, and lets you know if there’s a problem and how to rectify it, before there’s even a problem.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Education & Support</h3>
					<p>MyMoneyZen is a holistic approach. You're provided with everything you need to take control of your money and revolutionise this part of your life. Education, a powerful tool and coaching videos, to support you with the uncomfortable side of money, so you can get set up and start kicking goals.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>“Before I felt like there were so many bills, and now I feel like there is plenty of money”</li>
						<li>“MyMoneyZen has helped us create peace of mind. After the initial set up time we have then been able to get on with our lives and know we are living within our means as well as working towards our goals. What a great philosophy and system it is.”</li>
						<li>“MyMoneyZen was great for getting down to the nitty gritty of what exactly was needed to get on top of my finances. The focus on having everything then automated by setting up scheduled bank transfers felt like magic once it was all setup. Easy and fun, does actually make it easy.”</li>
